## What is it?

An example CRUD app showcasing the use of Redux, React and friends, based on [this excellent tutorial](http://spapas.github.io/2016/03/02/react-redux-tutorial/).

Here are some differences though:

- backend is written in Express.js and not in Django
- this app manages expenses and expense categories instead of books and authors 

The purpose of the project is to provide a **simple** example of a Redux application and all corresponding boilerplate. 

## How to run it
